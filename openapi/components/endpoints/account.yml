      summary: Retrieve an Account's Operations
      description: This endpoint represents successful operations for a given account and can be used in streaming mode. Streaming mode allows you to listen for new operations for this account as they are added to the Stellar ledger. If called in streaming mode, Horizon will start at the earliest known operation unless a cursor is set, in which case it will start from that cursor. By setting the cursor value to now, you can stream operations created since your request time.
